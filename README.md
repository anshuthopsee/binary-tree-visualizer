# binary-tree-visualizer

A tool to visualize Binary-Tree and Heap (Min Heap/Max Heap) data structures made with vanilla JS. 

I came across University of San Francisco's Min Heap visualization tool ([link](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Heap.html)) and thought it would be an interesting tool to try and replicate.
