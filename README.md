# binary-tree-visualizer

A tool to visualize Binary-Tree and Heap (Min Heap/Max Heap) data structures made with vanilla JS. 

I came across University of San Fransisco's Min Heap visualization tool (https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Heap.html) and thought it would be an interesting tool to try and replicate.
